Pyglet-Games
============

Decided to make a few games for a family member for christmas. Decided this was a good chance to try out pyglet also.

I will continue to update this when I get bored/frustrated with my other project, The Practitioner.

You can use the code here for whatever you want, enjoy.


# Note, only the code is mine. Most of the game ideas came from http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapters/
